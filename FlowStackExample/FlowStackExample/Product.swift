              description: "The Apple II is an 8-bit home computer and one of the world's first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products. It was designed primarily by Steve Wozniak; Jerry Manock developed the design of Apple II's foam-molded plastic case, Rod Holt developed the switching power supply, while Steve Jobs's role in the design of the computer was limited to overseeing Jerry Manock's work on the plastic case. It was introduced by Jobs and Wozniak at the 1977 West Coast Computer Faire, and marks Apple's first launch of a personal computer aimed at a consumer marketâ€”branded toward American households rather than businessmen or computer hobbyists.",

Running the Apple SOS operating system, it was intended as the successor to the Apple II series, but was largely considered a failure in the market.

The Lisa 2/5 was a bundle that included a Lisa 2 and an external 5- or 10-megabyte hard drive. In 1984, Apple offered free upgrades to the Lisa 2/5 for all Lisa 1 owners by swapping the Twiggy drives for a 3.5-inch drive and updating the boot ROM and I/O ROM. The Lisa 2 also featured a new front faceplate with the new inlaid Apple logo and the first Snow White design language elements. The Lisa 2/10 had a 10MB internal hard drive and a standard configuration of 1 MB of RAM.",

The SE also had a built-in 9-inch black-and-white CRT monitor, floppy disk drive, and an internal hard drive, making it one of the most advanced computers of its time. It was popular among businesses and home users alike due to its reliability and ease of use. The Macintosh SE also had a great impact on the design of future Apple computers, with its compact and functional design language becoming a hallmark of the brand. Despite its initial release being over 30 years ago, the Macintosh SE remains a well-regarded piece of computing history and is still in use today by retro enthusiasts.",

It was an improved version of the Macintosh Classic, featuring a larger 10-inch color display with a resolution of 512x384 pixels. With the addition of color to the Classic's design, the Color Classic was praised for its vibrant and sharp graphics, and was notably Apple's first consumer-level compact color display computer. It had a similar form factor to the original Macintosh, measuring at 13.6 x 12.8 x 9.0 inches and weighing 16.5 pounds. The Color Classic also improved upon the Classic with a faster processor, which ran at 16 MHz. Like its predecessor, it was often used as a budget-friendly option for home and education users. Despite its popularity during its initial release, the Macintosh Color Classic was only produced for two years before being replaced by newer models. However, it remains highly regarded among retro computing enthusiasts for its charming design and bright display.",
